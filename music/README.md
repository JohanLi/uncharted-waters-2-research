The MIDI tracks have been painstakingly created by a user called botxp: https://tieba.baidu.com/p/2753769314?pn=1

I’ve removed:
* The track numbers
* Chinese part of the filename
* Renamed `04.Victory in a Duel (海上航行音乐).mid`, `01.Caprice For Lute (约翰主题曲).mid`, and Ernest to Ernst

Conversion to ogg and mp3 are manually done through VLC on macOS.
